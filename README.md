Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia.

### Project Aims:

The aim of this project was to build a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia using the Python Django framework. Users can view available article entries, as well as search for entries on the site. New entries can be created by users, and existing entries can be edited. There is also a 'random page' function that selects and displays a page of the encyclopedia at random.Search allows the user to type a query into the search box in the sidebar to search for an encyclopedia entry if the query matches the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user is redirected to that entryâ€™s page else  the user is instead taken to a search results page that displays a list of all encyclopedia entries that have the query as a substring.
